# What is this
This script uses the sc2 client API and sc2unmasked.com API to figure out the own and opponent's MMR.

The script can then display streamer's MMR, opponent's name and race and MMR and even stream link if he is streaming right now.

The script could also use twitch chat to shoutout the opponent streamer link in chat.
