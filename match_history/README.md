# Idea

This script could read the replay of the last game, check the matchup, game duration, opponent name and mmr difference.

Then it uses the info to display the last X games on stream, e.g.

```
LOSS TvP vs Saixy (5500 mmr)
LOSS TvT vs MAAPK (3500 mmr)
```

It could also list the mapname, game duration, mmr difference instead of opponent mmr
