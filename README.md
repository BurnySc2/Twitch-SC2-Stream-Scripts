# Twitch-SC2-Stream-Scripts

WORK IN PROGRESS

# What is this
This is a repository for my twitch stream scripts that I plan to publish and polish at one point. I will try to maintain and update them. There will be **no GUI** for these scripts because I don't want to put 90% of the work just for the GUI.

These scripts will be orientated around Python 3.7, StarCraft 2, OBS Studio and Twitch.

These scripts will use and interact with the Twitch-API, Twitch Chat, StarCraft 2 Client API, SC2Unmasked API, StarCraft 2 replay parsers.
HTML files (for OBS as overlay) and twitch chat will be used as output sources.
